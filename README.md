# attocube ANC350 GUI Python
anc350_controller is a custom GUI I wrote for easy and precise control of sample position using attocube ANC350 motion controller.
This is a Python 2.7 implementation with two dependencies: `Tkinter` - for creating the GUI, and [`pyanc350`](https://github.com/Laukei/attocube-ANC350-Python-library) - which implements a python class for the C++ control functions provided by attocube (included as .dll files). The five files `anc350v2.dll`, `libusb0.dll`, `msvcp71d.dll`, `msvcr71d.dll`, and `nhconnect.dll` must be located in the same directory as `anc350_controller.py` for the GUI to run properly.
